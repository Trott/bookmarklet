*Mobile browsers require several taps and some copy-paste to install a bookmarklet, but if you take a few minutes to set it up, the mobile version is easy to use. *

## Part One: Setup
1. On iPad, go to **Settings** and tap **Safari**
2. Set **Show Favorites Bar** > ON
3. iPhone has no favorites bar, so skip and go to Part Two

*You can control what appears in your iPad Favorites Bar by opening Safari and tapping the bookmarks icon (open book) in the upper right. Then tap Edit.*

## Part Two: Creating the Bookmark
1. Open **Safari** browser and view this page (the one you're reading now)
2. Tap on the **share icon** ![share icon](img/share-icon.png)
3. Tap **Bookmark** to save this page ![bookmark icon](img/bookmark-icon.png)
4. Ensure that it will be saving to **Locations** > **Favorites** and then tap **Done**

## Part Three: Editing the Bookmarklet
1. Select and copy the bookmarklet code at bottom of this page
2. Tap the **bookmarks icon** ![bookmark no text](img/bookmark-icon-notext.png) and be sure you're viewing **Favorites**
3. Tap **Edit**
4. Select the bookmark saved in Part Two, called **Reload via EZproxy**
5. Tap the **address/URL field** and clear it by tapping the **x**
6. Tap on the word **Address**, and tap **Paste** to add the javascript code
7. Tap **Done** twice: once in the keyboard and once at lower corner of the Favorites box

## Using the Bookmarklet
1. Open Safari: on iPad you now have a visible **Favorites Bar** below the URL/Address line with **Reload via EZproxy** bookmarklet. On iPhone there is no bar, but tap **Bookmarks icon** to view)
2. NOTE: Bookmarklet is only needed if you go *directly* to a journal website rather than through the UCSF Library website.

4. Once authenticated as UCSF, you should get the full text.
